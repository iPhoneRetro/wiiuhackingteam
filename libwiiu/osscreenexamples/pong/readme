#Note. Using haxxed version of the draw library to render at twice the resolution per pixel to improve framerate. Basically I modified the drawPixel function. Makefile was and headers were changed to include local copy. Unless you care about speed and want to work off of this engine, please use the library instead, or better yet add support to the main draw libs to support upscaling.
